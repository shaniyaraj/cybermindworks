          <p>
            We know that businesses need reports & analytics<br /> to take data driven decisions for their business.
            We <br />hence built a comprehensive dashboard that gives <br/>useful insights for the business owners.
            Reports <br />include best selling services by gender, heat map of <br />customers visit time,

            We noticed that businesses often rely on external<br /> marketing softwares even for the simple needs.<br />
             Hence we went ahead and built a marketing engine <br />
            that is contextual. Here we allow business to 
            target<br /> their customer segments like ActiveCustomers,
            <br /> InActive Customers etc. This targeting 
            greatly <br />improves the success of their marketing campaigns 
            <br />and all this happens in just 3 Steps.

          <h2>Take Appointments</h2>
          <p>
            Profitabill comes with built in appointment system<br />
            that tracks appoinments across branches and also<br />
            blocks the time of the staff - thereby preventing<br />
            clash. The customer gets an SMS alert when they<br />
            book an appointment and also few minutes before<br />
            the appointment commences. This significantly<br />
            reduces no show of customers.
